The code should run as is, although the paths of data files might need to be edited to make the code work in JupyterNotebook,

In data/, the .csv files prefixed with "deltas" were relevant to the milestone and benchmark, but were not used for the second portion of the project. The files starting with "raw_data" are relevant to the second portion of the project.

In scripts/, dTree_bayes.py implements the incremental feature selection approach for Regression Tree and Gaussian Naive-Bayes, and feature_select.py implements the recursive approach for ETC and SVM.

JupyterNotebook files for those two approaches are included in scripts/ as well.
